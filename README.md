# CounterStrike-Warcraft-Mod
An addon for Counter Strike Source utilizing Event Script for Python that added classes from Warcraft III

# History
I worked on this project back in 2012. At the time Counter-Strike Source was the game of my life.

There was a mod out at the time that added classes to the game and I wanted to re-create it and make my own version of it so I could extend it beyond what it was capable of.

This utilizied the now offline [Event Scripts for Python](https://web.archive.org/web/20121119143538/http://python.eventscripts.com/pages/Main_Page) which created events for every game action that you could hook into them and preform actions.

I was even able to dig up some of their old forum posts where I was asking questions regarding the project [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20140815233922/http://forums.eventscripts.com/viewtopic.php?f=90&t=45154) and [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20140815233929/http://forums.eventscripts.com/viewtopic.php?f=90&t=45081)

This was the first largest project that I worked on. It was all developed by me asking my father questions here and there, and reaching out online when I was really stumped.
